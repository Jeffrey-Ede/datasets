# Warwick Electron Microscopy Datasets

This repository is for the preprint|paper "Warwick Electron Microscopy Datasets". There are three main datasets containing 19769 experimental STEM images, 17266 experimental TEM images, and 98340 simulated TEM exit wavefunctions. Datasets are available [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/condensedmatt/microscopy/research/machinelearning/). This repository contains scripts used to curate datasets, their variants, and to create both static and interactive visualizations.
