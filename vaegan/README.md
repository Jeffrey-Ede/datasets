# Variational Autoencoders

This directory is for variational autoecoders (VAEs). It contains their source code, dataset encodings, points in tSNE visualizations (for interactive visualizations), and modified tSNE implementations.

Our VAE code is is adapted from VAE-GAN code [here](https://github.com/zhangqianhui/vae-gan-tensorflow).

## Experiments

There are five directories containing source code for VAE experiments:

`1`: Stem crops  
`2`: Downsampled STEM  
`3`: Downsampled TEM  
`4`: STEM crops without gradient loss  
`5`: STEM crops with Kullback-Liebler divergence, rather than feature normalization and regularization.

## Uniform tSNE


## tSNE with Errors



## Pretrained Models

Pretrained VAEs for `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` and `5` can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vdEKgrg6ymsvBO0LnwCPbfpeqZ9Z7Kan?usp=sharing).
